	DASHBOARD LAYOUT.
Certainly, I can provide you with a basic layout for a dashboard page in your Django application for keeping records of construction materials. This layout will include the main components typically found in a dashboard, and you can customize it further to match your specific design preferences and application needs.

Here's a simple dashboard layout using HTML and CSS:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Dashboard - Construction Material Records</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> <!-- Add your CSS file here -->
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Construction Material Records Dashboard</h1>
        <p>Welcome, [User's Name]!</p>
        <a href="/logout">Log Out</a>
    </header>
    
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a></li>
            <li><a href="/projects">Projects</a></li>
            <li><a href="/materials">Materials</a></li>
            <li><a href="/reports">Reports</a></li>
            <li><a href="/profile">Profile</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    
    <main>
        <section class="overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <!-- Add summary data here, e.g., total projects, materials used, etc. -->
        </section>
        
        <section class="project-list">
            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <!-- List of projects with links to their details -->
        </section>
        
        <section class="recent-activity">
            <h2>Recent Activity</h2>
            <!-- Display recent material usage or project updates here -->
        </section>
    </main>
    
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2023 Construction Material Records</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
In this basic layout:

The header includes the application name, a welcome message with the user's name, and a "Log Out" link.
The navigation menu provides links to different sections of your application, such as the dashboard, projects, materials, reports, and user profile.
The main content area is divided into three sections: an overview, a project list, and recent activity. You can fill these sections with relevant data and information.
The footer includes a copyright notice.
Remember to link to your CSS file (styles.css) to apply styles and formatting to this dashboard layout. You can use CSS to customize the appearance of the dashboard, including fonts, colors, and layout.

This is a simple starting point for your dashboard layout. Depending on your specific requirements and design preferences, you can add more features, interactivity, and styles to enhance the user experience.
